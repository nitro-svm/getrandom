// Polls /dev/random to make sure it is ok to read from /dev/urandom.

// Polling avoids draining the estimated entropy from /dev/random;
// short-lived processes reading even a single byte from /dev/random could
// be problematic if they are being executed faster than entropy is being
// collected.
//
// OTOH, reading a byte instead of polling is more compatible with
// sandboxes that disallow `poll()` but which allow reading /dev/random,
// e.g. sandboxes that assume that `poll()` is for network I/O. This way,
// fewer applications will have to insert pre-sandbox-initialization logic.
// Often (blocking) file I/O is not allowed in such early phases of an
// application for performance and/or security reasons.
//
// It is hard to write a sandbox policy to support `libc::poll()` because
// it may invoke the `poll`, `ppoll`, `ppoll_time64` (since Linux 5.1, with
// newer versions of glibc), and/or (rarely, and probably only on ancient
// systems) `select`. depending on the libc implementation (e.g. glibc vs
// musl), libc version, potentially the kernel version at runtime, and/or
// the target architecture.
//
// BoringSSL and libstd don't try to protect against insecure output from
// `/dev/urandom'; they don't open `/dev/random` at all.
//
// OpenSSL uses `libc::select()` unless the `dev/random` file descriptor
// is too large; if it is too large then it does what we do here.
//
// libsodium uses `libc::poll` similarly to this.
